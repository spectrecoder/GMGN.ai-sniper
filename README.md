# Report 

## 1. Environment Setup:
•	Install and configure the Solana CLI for Devnet.
•	Set up a Solana wallet and fund it with test SOL from the Devnet faucet.
•	Install dependencies (e.g., Solana-Web3.js, Node.js, etc.).


## Deliverable:
•	Screenshot or logs showing the wallet connection and successful Devnet configuration.

### - report1
![Solana Config](https://github.com/spectrecoder/GMGN.ai-sniper/blob/main/img/solana-config.png?raw=true)

	
## 2. GMGN.ai Integration:
•	Research the GMGN.ai API documentation (or use mock data if APIs are not available).
•	Establish a connection to the GMGN.ai platform to pull token listing data.

Deliverable:
•	A basic script that connects to GMGN.ai and fetches live or simulated token listing data.

### - Report2: Basic script with Mock API
	
## 3. Basic Bot Functionality:
•	Build a simple bot script that continuously monitors the GMGN.ai Devnet for new token listings.
•	Implement a basic filter to log detected listings.

## Deliverable:
•	A functional bot script that logs detected listings to the console in real-time.

### - Report3: Bot script for pumpfun. Due to the lack of material and dev community of GMGN, I used 

## 4.	Testing and Validation:
•	Run the bot on the Solana Devnet to confirm detection functionality.
•	Ensure the bot can handle at least 3–5 mock listings from GMGN.ai.

## Deliverable:
•	Console output logs showing successful detection of token listings.

### - Report4: Solana devnet is down, so test didn't correctly.

## Success Criteria:

•	Setup Validation: Candidate demonstrates the ability to set up a Solana environment and wallet.
•	Functionality: Bot successfully detects and logs token listings from GMGN.ai on Devnet. 
•	Code Quality: Code is modular, clear, and easy to read. 
•	Time Management: Task is completed within the allocated day.

- Whole time: Analyze the requirements and design: 1 hr.
- Implementation and coding: 1 hr

## Tips for the Candidate:

•	Use tools like Postman to test GMGN.ai APIs if available.
•	For mock data, simulate token listings using a JSON file or a lightweight mock API.
•	Keep the codebase organized and share updates frequently to avoid missteps.
