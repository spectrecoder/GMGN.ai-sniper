1.	Environment Setup:
•	Install and configure the Solana CLI for Devnet.
•	Set up a Solana wallet and fund it with test SOL from the Devnet faucet.
•	Install dependencies (e.g., Solana-Web3.js, Node.js, etc.).

Deliverable:
•	Screenshot or logs showing the wallet connection and successful Devnet configuration.
	
2.	GMGN.ai Integration:
•	Research the GMGN.ai API documentation (or use mock data if APIs are not available).
•	Establish a connection to the GMGN.ai platform to pull token listing data.

Deliverable:
•	A basic script that connects to GMGN.ai and fetches live or simulated token listing data.
	
3.	Basic Bot Functionality:
•	Build a simple bot script that continuously monitors the GMGN.ai Devnet for new token listings.
•	Implement a basic filter to log detected listings.

Deliverable:
•	A functional bot script that logs detected listings to the console in real-time.

4.	Testing and Validation:
•	Run the bot on the Solana Devnet to confirm detection functionality.
•	Ensure the bot can handle at least 3–5 mock listings from GMGN.ai.

Deliverable:
•	Console output logs showing successful detection of token listings.

Success Criteria:

•	Setup Validation: Candidate demonstrates the ability to set up a Solana environment and wallet.
•	Functionality: Bot successfully detects and logs token listings from GMGN.ai on Devnet.
•	Code Quality: Code is modular, clear, and easy to read.
•	Time Management: Task is completed within the allocated day.

Tips for the Candidate:

•	Use tools like Postman to test GMGN.ai APIs if available.
•	For mock data, simulate token listings using a JSON file or a lightweight mock API.
•	Keep the codebase organized and share updates frequently to avoid missteps.
